# Batch

- **Description** - Batch is a scripting language used in Windows operating systems for automating repetitive tasks. It is primarily used for creating batch files, which are plain text files containing a series of commands that are executed in sequence. Batch files have a file extension of ".bat" and can be run by double-clicking on them or by typing their name in the command prompt. Batch scripting is commonly used for tasks such as file management, system configuration, and running multiple commands simultaneously.
