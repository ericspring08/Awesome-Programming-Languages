- [CSS](Languages/CSS.md) - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
- [Dart](Languages/Dart.md) - Dart is a programming language that lets you build web and mobile apps natively and was developed by Google.
- [Delphi](Languages/Delphi.md) - Delphi is a general-purpose programming language and a software product that uses the Delphi dialect of the Object Pascal programming language and provides an integrated development environment.
- [Dot Net](Languages/DotNet.md) - .NET is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework.
- [F#](Languages/Fsharp.md) - F# is a functional-first, general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language.
- [Go](Languages/Go.md) - Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
- [Groovy](Languages/Groovy.md) - Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform.
- [Haskell](Languages/Haskell.md) - Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation
- [Java](Languages/Java.md) - Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
- [Javascript](Languages/Javascript.md) - JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments.
- [Julia](Languages/Julia.md) - Julia is a dynamic, high-performance, compiler based programming language that is used to perform operations in scientific computing. Similar to R Programming Language, Julia is used for statistical computations and data analysis. Julia was built mainly because of its speed in programming, it has much faster execution as compared to Python and R.
- [Kotlin](Languages/Kotlin.md) - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, originally developed and unveiled as Project Kotlin by JetBrains in 2011.
